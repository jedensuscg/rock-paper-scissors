**KNOWN ISSUES**
FIxed: Restarting game not restarting total score. Each game still last until 5 wins still. (forgot to expose my resetScores function in the scoreboard module)

Game consists of as many rounds as it takes for either the player or the computer to get 5 wins. The score board will show the results of the last 5 rounds.
